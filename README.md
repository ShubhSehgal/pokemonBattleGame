# pokemonBattleGame

The following code runs a simple text based pokemon battle game. Here is how the game works:

    The user is prompted to choose a pokemon to battle with, and the computer choses a pokemon as well.
    Once the pokemon are chosen, the user and computer chose a move for their pokemon to use.
    Each pokemon has four corresponding moves to choose from.
    The moves can either deal damage, heal, or do both.
    This game continues until one pokemon faints (HP hits 0), and the game ends. 
    The first pokemon to hit 0 HP loses.
